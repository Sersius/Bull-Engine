# Bull-Engine
This game engine has been made for the Game Engines subjects of the 3rd year in the Game and Development grade of CITM. It's a basic game engine with controls like unity with a audio system.
This system is the implementation of the audio engine Wwise. In our game engine you can create audio listeners, audio sources and reverv zones.

## Main core sub-systems

### 3D Renderer
Our engine has a module that handles all th drawing made in the engine without using shaders, instead we use OpenGL Arrays with indices except for the draw of primitives that are rendered directly.

### Geometry loader
Our engine can read and extract all the data from models with Assimp in order ti render the mesh on screen.

### GameObject structure
All gameobjects have a tree structure so the transformation of the parent affects all of his childern. All of this gameobjects and children have their own AABB box that can be filtered by the frustrum culling.

### Serialization
For identify all the different gameobject there are in the scene we use UUIDs (Universally unique identifier). The UUIDs are generated by a random number of 32 bits.

### Mouse picking
For pick a gameobject in the scene we use mouse picking using the Raycast method. When the ray is cast collect all the gameobject inside the frustrum that intersect with the ray and then loop through all the gameobjects calculating all its triangles to see which gameobject was picked first.

### Time management and Game mode
Our engine has a internal game clock that will run when the Game mode is active, so its dt will be passed to all the upadtes instead of the dt from the app. And the Game mode is to see the scene through the game camera.

## Audio sub-system
For the audio sub-system we use [Wwise](https://www.audiokinetic.com/products/wwise/) to use audio banks in the engine. We have implemented 3 audio components:

### Audio Source
With this component we reproduce audio, depending on the side you can hear the audio from the right or left part of the headphones

* Option for mute de audio source.

* Change the volume with this slider.

### Audio Listener
This component allows you to hear in the engine.

### Reverb Zone
This component changes the reverberation of an audio if the audio source is inside the reverb zone.

* You can modify the radius of the affected area.
